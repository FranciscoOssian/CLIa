# Clia - Your AI-Powered Terminal Assistant

**Clia** is a CLI tool designed to help developers directly from the terminal using AI. Built for devs by devs, Clia uses the Gemini AI model to assist you in analyzing errors, running commands, and providing solutions in real time.

## Features

- **Chat with AI**: Use `$clia chat` to start a conversation with Clia. You can ask questions, get coding help, and even request debugging advice.
